    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re a Kingdom Hearts 2 player, you're probably curious about the sea
      salt ice cream that Axel, Roxas, and Xion eat in the game. If you want to
      know what it tastes like, you can easily recreate the recipe at home and
      enjoy sea salt ice with your friends in just a few hours!
    </p>

    <p>
      The recipe works best if you use an ice cream maker, but if you don’t have
      one, don’t worry⁠—you can still make sea salt ice cream without it.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs, separated</li>
      <li>cups (470 ml) of milk</li>
      <li>1/3 cup (67 g) of white granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla</li>
      <li>1 cup (240 ml) of heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon (4.2 g) of sea salt</li>
      <li>12 drops of blue food coloring</li>
      <li>3 drops of green food coloring</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Separate the eggs into 2 separate bowls. Crack each egg, 1 at a time,
        and separate the whites from the yolks. Put the yolks in 1 bowl, and the
        whites in another bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the egg whites until they’re stiff. Use an electric mixer or stand
        mixer set on a low speed for the best results. Keep beating the egg
        whites until they form stiff peaks, which usually takes about 5 minutes.
        You can use a whisk to beat the egg whites manually if you don’t have a
        mixer, but it will take a little more effort and elbow grease! Once the
        egg whites are stiff, set the bowl aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix 1/3 cup (67 g) of sugar with the egg yolks. Measure out the white
        granulated sugar and dump it into the bowl with the egg yolks. Stir the
        ingredients together until they’re fully incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 cups (470 ml) of milk in a pot or saucepan until it simmers.
        Measure out the milk and pour it into a small pot or saucepan. Place the
        pot or saucepan on your stovetop and heat the milk over medium heat.
        Stir the mixture occasionally as you bring it to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the heated milk into the yolk and sugar mixture. Remove the milk
        from the heat once it starts to simmer. Use a pot holder to carefully
        transfer the hot milk to the bowl with the yolks and white sugar. Stir
        the ingredients until they’re fully combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the milk mixture to the pot and heat it until it thickens. Pour
        the milk mixture back into your pot or saucepan. Turn the heat to medium
        and let the mixture cook until it takes on a thick, custard-like
        texture. This should only take a few minutes. Don't let the mixture come
        to a boil or the eggs will scramble!
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the thickened mixture into the bowl of egg whites. Use a pot holder
        to lift the pot or saucepan off the stove and carefully pour the hot,
        thick mixture into the bowl of stiff egg whites. Stir the mixture well
        with a wooden spoon to incorporate the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir about 1 teaspoon (4.2 g) of sea salt into the mixture. You can
        adjust the amount of sea salt according to your personal tastes, but 1
        teaspoon (4.2 g) will give you a nice balance of sweet and salty
        flavors. Be careful not to over-salt the mixture. Use sea salt for this
        recipe. Regular table salt won’t give you the results you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and chill the mixture in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Stretch
        plastic wrap over the mouth of the bowl to cover the mixture. Place the
        covered bowl in your refrigerator for about half an hour to chill the
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the heavy whipping cream and vanilla into the chilled mixture. Take
        out the bowl and uncover it. Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of heavy
        whipping cream and 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla and dump them into the
        cooled mixture. Stir the mixture thoroughly with a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the blue and green food coloring. To give the sea salt ice cream its
        signature color, add 12 drops of blue and 3 drops of green food coloring
        to the mixture. Fold the food coloring into the mixture and stir the
        ingredients until the texture and color are consistent. You can adjust
        the number of drops for each color to customize the hue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker and freeze it. Transfer the
        mixture to your ice cream maker and place it in the freezer. Follow your
        ice cream maker's instructions for freezing. Let the mixture freeze
        completely. If you don't have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into
        metal cake pans and put them in the freezer. When the edges get firm,
        remove the mixture and stir it. Repeat this several times until the
        mixture is uniformly frozen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the mixture to molds and freeze the popsicles for 2 hours. You
        don’t have to do this, but if you want to recreate the look from the
        game, use ice pop molds. Place popsicle sticks into the molds and fill
        them with the mixture. Freeze the ice pops for 2-3 hours and enjoy! If
        you can wait, it's best to freeze the ice cream overnight before eating
        it.
